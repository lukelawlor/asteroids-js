						<h2 id="canvas">The Canvas</h2>
					</a>
					<p id="textCanvas">Everything rendered in the game is done using the HTML5 Canvas. Canvases can be
						drawn to and cleared with JavaScript. You can create a canvas using the <b>canvas</b> HTML tag
						as shown below:</p>
					<div class="code">
						&lt;canvas id="can" width="0" height="0"&gt;<br>
						&emsp;Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas<br>
						&lt;/canvas&gt;<br>
					</div>
					<p id="textCanvas2">
						The text inside the tag is shown if the client's browser is outdated and does not support the
						canvas. The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> attributes specify the dimensions of the canvas in
						pixels. Notice that there is a distinction between these values and the CSS width and height of
						the canvas. In this example, the dimensions are set to 0x0 because they will be changed later
						with JS.
					</p>
					<p id="textCanvas3">
						To interact with the canvas in JS, we must reference it with <b>document.getElementById()</b>.
						To draw to it, we must get the 2D context of the canvas.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						var cv = document.getElementById("can");<br>
						cv.width = GAME_WIDTH;<br>
						cv.height = GAME_HEIGHT;<br>
						var c = cv.getContext("2d", {alpha: false});<br>
					</div>
					<p id="textCanvas4">The context of the canvas is obtained with <b>cv.getContext("2d", {alpha:
							false})</b>. Passing <b>{alpha: false}</b> removes the transparent background of the canvas
						to improve performance. It is optional. I named the context variable <b>c</b> so it can be typed
						easily, because we will be using it to draw to the canvas often.
					</p>

					<div class="vr-big"></div>

					<a href="#drawing">
						<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>
					</a>
					<p id="textDrawing1">
						Drawing to the canvas is done using the 2D context we obtained earlier. Image files can be drawn
						by passing an <b>Image</b> variable along with the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> coordinates to draw to.
						Example:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						var sImage = new Image();<br>
						sImage.src = "path/to/image.png";<br>
						<br>
						c.drawImage(sImage, 0, 0);<br>
					</div>
					<p id="textDrawing2">
						This will draw an image to the top left corner of the canvas (position 0,0). If you run this
						code unaltered, however, you likely won't see anything appear, because you must wait for images
						to load before drawing them. This can be done by setting the <b>onload</b> value of the image to
						a function that checks if all images you plan on using have loaded. This is how images are
						loaded in the game:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						var imagesLoaded = 0;<br>
						var imagesNeeded = 7;<br>
						var imagesToLoad = [sSpaceship, sBullet, sAsteroid, sAlert1, sAlert2, sBg1, sBg2];<br>
						<br>
						function imageLoaded()<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;if ((++imagesLoaded) &gt;= imagesNeeded)<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;gmTitle();<br>
						}<br>
						<br>
						for (var i = 0; i &lt; imagesToLoad.length; ++i)<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;imagesToLoad[i].onload = imageLoaded;<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="textDrawing3">
						This code waits for all images to load, then calls <b>gmTitle()</b> which starts the game. Feel
						free to optimize this code if you plan on reusing it. I haven't optimized the code in this case
						because it has little impact on performance. What does have impact on performance, however, is
						drawing the images themselves.
					</p>
					<p id="textDrawing4">
						To draw a rotated image (which is done with the spaceship), you must translate and rotate the
						canvas context before calling <b>drawImage</b>. In the game, this is done with this function:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						function oSpaceshipDraw(x, y)<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;c.save();<br>
						&emsp;c.translate(x, y);<br>
						&emsp;c.rotate(this.dir);<br>
						&emsp;c.drawImage(sSpaceship, -this.w / 2, -this.h / 2);<br>
						&emsp;c.restore();<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="textDrawing5">
						<b>c.save()</b> saves the current state of the canvas context. Then, the context is translated
						by the x and y coordinates of the ship, and rotated. The x and y coordinates used in
						<b>drawImage</b> are relative to the x and y coordinates we translated the context by. In this
						case, the negatives of the half of the width and height of the ship are passed to position the
						ship in the center of the x and y coordinates we are drawing to. Finally, <b>c.restore()</b> is
						called, which undoes all of the translations and rotations, so that next time we draw something,
						it isn't translated and rotated somewhere random.
					</p>
					<p id="textDrawing6">
						To avoid rotated image bluriness, as done in the game, the canvas context variable
						<b>imageSmoothingEnabled</b> must be set to <b>false</b>.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						c.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
					</div>

					<div class="vr-big"></div>

					<a href="#input">
						<h2 id="input">Keyboard Input</h2>
					</a>
					<p id="inputText1">To detect keyboard input, two event listeners are added to the document that
						check for key presses and releases. These are added with the <b>document</b> function
						<b>addEventListener</b> which takes two parameters. These include a string specifying the type
						of event to listen for, in this case <b>"keydown"</b> or <b>"keyup"</b>, and a function to call
						when the event is activated, which an event object is automatically passed to.
					</p>
					<p id="inputText2">
						The <b>keyCode</b> variable of the event object contains an integer that represents the ID of
						the key being pressed or released. A switch statement is used to check which key code
						corresponds to which key variable. They key variables are set to 1 when activated in the
						<b>keydown</b> event and 0 in the <b>keyup</b> event.
					</p>
					<p id="inputText3">
						To find the key code of a desired key, you can find a table online containing all key codes, or
						if you prefer to not visit any other sites, write a function yourself that prints the key code
						of the last pressed key.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						// Keyboard Input<br>

					</div>
					<p id="inputText4">
						Key codes <b>37</b> through <b>40</b> represent the arrow keys. When they are activated in the
						<b>keydown</b> event, the function <b>preventDefault</b> of the event object is called to
						prevent the default action of these keys, which scroll around the page. Without calling this
						function, the player would unintentionally scroll around the webpage when trying to play, which
						makes games nearly unplayable.
					</p>
					<p id="inputText5">
						With these two <b>keydown</b> and <b>keyup</b> events we can now detect when keys are held down,
						but not when they are initially pressed. To implement key press detection, the function
						<b>stopKeyRepeat</b> is used, which simply sets the keys we only want to detect initial presses
						on to <b>0</b>.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						function stopKeyRepeat()<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;k2 = 0;<br>

					<p id="inputText6">
						This function is called every game loop after objects are done updating. When the keys it
						affects are pressed and set to <b>1</b>, the game objects will run their update function once
						before the key is set back to <b>0</b>, only activated upon another initial press of the key.
						The game loop is a function that evaluates every game frame, and it will be explained in the
						next section.

						itself again in 1/60 of a second, resulting in game frames being drawn at 60 frames per second.
					</p>
					<p id="objectsText2">
						To render a frame, the <b>gmLoop</b> function clears the canvas, draws the background, executes
						the update function of all objects that may draw themselves, and finally executes more code that

						Object instances are kept in the <b>inst</b> array. To update them, the <b>inst</b> array is

						functions contain the code executed by each instance every frame. These usually include moving
						the instance, checking for collisions, and drawing the instance.
					</p>
					<p id="objectsText4">
						New object instances are created using the function <b>makeInst</b> as a constructor. You can

					</p>
					<div class="code">

					</div>
					<p id="objectsText5">
						The third argument of <b>makeInst</b> is the ID of the object type being created. 0 is used for
						the creation of the player's ship, 1 is used for bullets, 2 is used for asteroids, and so forth.
						3 is passed to this <b>makeInst</b> in this example because it creates the alert objects that
						flash for a few seconds before spawning an asteroid.

						Object instances are added to the <b>inst</b> array as soon as the <b>makeInst</b> function is
						called. If there is no room left in the array for new instances, the instance being created will
						overwrite another instance as long as the instance's <b>ps</b> variable, which indicates
						persistence, is not set to <b>true</b>. The object-specific variables and update function are
						determined by the switch statement.
					</p>
					<p id="objectsText8">
						Sometimes different objects execute the same sets of code, such as collision checking and screen
						wrapping. These are stored in functions so that they don't have to be written over and over
						again for each object. For an object instance to call these functions properly, a reference to
						one of them must be stored in an instance variable, and then called from that reference. This is
						demonstrated in the following code:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						// Get a reference to the function<br>
						this.shoot = oSpaceshipShoot;<br>
						<br>
						// Call the function<br>
						this.shoot();<br>
					</div>
					<p id="objectsText9">
						Calling the function without a reference causes the keyword <b>this</b> to not reference the
						object instance. It is valid to call functions without a reference that do not need to reference
						the instance calling the object, such as <b>gmEnd</b>, which simply ends the game without
						accessing any instance variables, though this is rarely done.
					</p>
					<p id="objectsText10">
						To summarize, <b>gameLoop</b> is called 60 times a second to draw a new game frame and update
						object instances by calling their <b>ud</b> function.

					<p id="physicsText1">
						The spaceship object keeps track of the direction it points in with its <b>dir</b> variable, and
						keeps track of its momentum in two arrays, <b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b>, both of equal
						length. When the up key is held, the object adds the amount of pixels it should move
						horizontally and vertically in <b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b> respectively, this is
						calculated with sine and cosine waves with the direction of the ship as input.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						// Move ship<br>
						if (ku)<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;this.xforces[this.force] = Math.cos(this.dir) * this.forceSpeed;<br>

						<br>
						&emsp;++this.force;<br>
						&emsp;if (this.force &gt;= PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT)<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;this.force = 0;<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="physicsText2">
						The more the direction is turned to 0 or pi radians, the more the ship will move horizontally,
						and the more the direction is turned to pi/2 or 3pi/2 radians, the more the ship will move
						vertically. The forces added are multipled by <b>forceSpeed</b> to control the speed that the
						ship picks up each frame.
					</p>
					<p id="physicsText3">
						Indexes of the <b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b> arrays are accessed with the variable
						<b>force</b>. Each time forces are added, <b>force</b> increments to move to the next index, and
						loops back to 0 when the end of the arrays, stored in <b>PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT</b>, are reached.
					</p>
					<p id="physicsText4">
						The forces are finally applied to the ship and move it in the loop below, which is executed
						regardless of whether or not the up key is held down.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						// Apply movement<br>
						for (var i = 0; i &lt; PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT; ++i)<br>

						&emsp;this.y += this.yforces[i];<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="physicsText5">
						In the end, this creates a system where forces applied in past frames still move the ship until
						the ship either moves for long enough that the forces are overwritten, or the ship moves in the
						opposite direction to balance the force. This is why the ship "drifts" ingame instead of staying
						still or immediately changing the direction of movement once any amount of force is added.

						<h2 id="wrapping">Screen Wrapping</h2>
					</a>
					<p id="wrappingText1">
						To keep the player and asteroids within the bounds of the screen, the x and y values of the
						objects are reset once they reach the edge of the screen.
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						function oWorldWrap()<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;if (this.x &gt; GAME_WIDTH)<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;this.x = GAME_WIDTH - this.x;<br>

						&emsp;&emsp;this.y = GAME_HEIGHT + this.y;<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="wrappingText2">
						When the x and y values are reset, they are positioned relative to how far the object has move
						past the bounds of the screen. For example, if the screen with is 600 pixels and the object's x
						position is at 650, the x value will be reset to 0 plus 50 because it traveled 50 pixels beyond
						the screen. This results in no loss of movement when wrapping around the screen.
					</p>
					<p id="wrappingText3">
						The code above properly handles the coordinates of objects, but we still need to draw objects
						while they are wrapping from one side of the screen to the next to make wrapping entirely
						seamless. This is accomplished by drawing the objects in all 8 directions around them with the
						following code:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						function oDrawWrap()<br>
						{<br>
						&emsp;var xstop = this.x + GAME_WIDTH;<br>
						&emsp;var ystop = this.y + GAME_HEIGHT;<br>
						<br>
						&emsp;for (var x = this.x - GAME_WIDTH - 1; x &lt;= xstop; x += GAME_WIDTH)<br>
						&emsp;{<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;for (var y = this.y - GAME_HEIGHT - 1; y &lt;= ystop; y += GAME_HEIGHT)<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this.draw(x, y);<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
						&emsp;}<br>
						}<br>
					</div>
					<p id="wrappingText4">
						Each object is spaced horizontally by the screen width, and spaced vertically by the screen
						height. This effect causes objects to appear on top of the screen when wrapping from the bottom,
						on the left of the screen when wrapping from the right, and so forth.
					</p>
					<p id="wrappingText5">
						This draws a total of 9 images, so it should be used sparingly, as drawing is a computationally
						expensive operation. It also has room for optimization, as it can be edited to only draw objects
						based on the direction they are moving in.

						Bullets use two variables to move each frame, <b>hsp</b> and <b>vsp</b> which control the
						bullets' horizontal speed and vertical speed respectively. These are used instead of a direction
						and speed variable to control bullet movement because they only need to be calculated once,
						while direction calculations must be performed every frame to move a bullet. This improves
						performance, especially when many bullets objects are in action at once.
					</p>
					<p id="shootingText3">
						The rate at which bullets are fired are dependent on two variables in the spaceship object,
						<b>shootCooldown</b> and <b>shootCooldownReset</b>. <b>shootCooldown</b> is decremented each
						frame in the spaceship's <b>ud</b> function until it reaches <b>0</b>. When the Z key is pressed
						or held at this point, a bullet will be fired, and <b>shootCooldown</b> will be set to
						<b>shootCooldownReset</b>. The player must wait until <b>shootCooldown</b> reaches <b>0</b> to
						fire another bullet, or let go of the Z key to immediately set the cooldown to <b>0</b>. Below
						is the code that the spaceship runs to perform all of this:
					</p>
					<div class="code">

					<p id="asteroidsText2">

						This function is used by another two functions: <b>oCollideWithSmaller</b> and
						<b>oCollideWithLarger</b>. These functions are called by object instances to check for
						collisions between all instances of another type of object. This is done by looping through
						<b>inst</b> to find all instances of the object type and calling <b>checkRect</b> with their
						variables. If a collision is found, the instance collided with is returned, otherwise
						<b>null</b> is returned. Here is <b>oCollideWithSmaller</b>:
					</p>
					<div class="code">
						function oCollideWithSmaller(o, x1, y1, w1, h1, s1, s2, w2, h2)<br>
						{&emsp;<br>
						&emsp;var other; <br>
						&emsp;for (var i = 0; i &lt; MAX_INSTANCES; ++i)<br>
						&emsp;{<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;other = inst[i];<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;if (other != null &amp;&amp; other.o == o)<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;{<br>

						&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
						&emsp;}<br>
						&emsp;return null;<br>

					</div>
					<p id="collisionText3">
						The function <b>oCollideWithLarger</b> is identical to <b>oCollideWithSmaller</b> except the
						order of rectangles passed to <b>checkRect</b> is reversed. This is because the functionality of
						<b>checkRect</b> depends on the smaller rectangle being passed first. The two "collide with"
						functions exist to check for collisions with objects that are smaller than the calling instance
						or larger.
					</p>
					<p id="collisionText4">
						The reason two "collide with" functions exist despite much of their code being the same is to
						improve performance. If there was only one "collide with" function that required an extra if
						statement to determine which set of objects was smaller, performance would suffer, because that
						if statement would be run for every single instance of the object type being searched for.
