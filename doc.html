			yourself, or make an entirely different game with its mechanics
		</p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="canvas">The Canvas</h2>
			<p>
				Everything rendered in the game is done using the HTML5 Canvas. Canvases can be drawn to and cleared
				with JavaScript. You can create a canvas using the <b>canvas</b> HTML tag as shown below:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				&lt;canvas id="can" width="0" height="0"&gt;<br>
				<p class="tab">Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas</p>
				&lt;/canvas&gt;<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The text inside the tag is shown if the client's browser is outdated and does not support the canvas.
				The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> attributes specify the dimensions of the canvas in pixels. Notice
				that there is a distinction between these values and the CSS width and height of the canvas. In this
				example, the dimensions are set to 0x0 because they will be changed later with JS.
			</p>
			<p>
				To interact with the canvas in JS, we must reference it with <b>document.getElementById()</b>. To draw
				to it, we must get the 2D context of the canvas.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				var cv = document.getElementById("can");<br>
				cv.width = GAME_WIDTH;<br>
				cv.height = GAME_HEIGHT;<br>
				var c = cv.getContext("2d", {alpha: false});<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The context of the canvas is obtained with <b>cv.getContext("2d", {alpha: false})</b>. Passing
				<b>{alpha: false}</b> removes the transparent background of the canvas to improve performance. It is
				optional. I named the context variable <b>c</b> so it can be typed easily, because we will be using it
				to draw to the canvas often.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>
			<p>
				Drawing to the canvas is done using the 2D context we obtained earlier. Image files can be drawn by
				passing an <b>Image</b> variable along with the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> coordinates to draw to. Example:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				var sImage = new Image();<br>
				sImage.src = "path/to/image.png";<br>
				<br>
				c.drawImage(sImage, 0, 0);<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				This will draw an image to the top left corner of the canvas (position 0,0). If you run this code
				unaltered, however, you likely won't see anything appear, because you must wait for images to load
				before drawing them. This can be done by setting the <b>onload</b> value of the image to a function that
				checks if all images you plan on using have loaded. This is how images are loaded in the game:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				var imagesLoaded = 0;<br>
				var imagesNeeded = 7;<br>
				var imagesToLoad = [sSpaceship, sBullet, sAsteroid, sAlert1, sAlert2, sBg1, sBg2];<br>
				<br>
				function imageLoaded()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>if ((++imagesLoaded) &gt;= imagesNeeded)</p>
					<p class="tab">gmTitle();</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
				<br>
				for (var i = 0; i &lt; imagesToLoad.length; ++i)<br>
				{<br>
				<p class="tab">imagesToLoad[i].onload = imageLoaded;</p>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				This code waits for all images to load, then calls <b>gmTitle()</b> which starts the game. Feel free to
				optimize this code if you plan on reusing it. I haven't optimized the code in this case because it has
				little impact on performance. What does have impact on performance, however, is drawing the images
				themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				To draw a rotated image (which is done with the spaceship), you must translate and rotate the canvas
				context before calling <b>drawImage</b>. In the game, this is done with this function:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oSpaceshipDraw(x, y)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>c.save();</p>
					<p>c.translate(x, y);</p>
					<p>c.rotate(this.dir);</p>
					<p>c.drawImage(sSpaceship, -this.w / 2, -this.h / 2);</p>
					<p>c.restore();</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				<b>c.save()</b> saves the current state of the canvas context. Then, the context is translated by the x
				and y coordinates of the ship, and rotated. The x and y coordinates used in <b>drawImage</b> are
				relative to the x and y coordinates we translated the context by. In this case, the negatives of the
				half of the width and height of the ship are passed to position the ship in the center of the x and y
				coordinates we are drawing to. Finally, <b>c.restore()</b> is called, which undoes all of the
				translations and rotations, so that next time we draw something, it isn't translated and rotated
				somewhere random.
			</p>
			<p>
				To avoid rotated image bluriness, as done in the game, the canvas context variable
				<b>imageSmoothingEnabled</b> must be set to <b>false</b>.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				c.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="input">Keyboard Input</h2>
			<p>
				To detect keyboard input, two event listeners are added to the document that check for key presses and
				releases. These are added with the <b>document</b> function <b>addEventListener</b> which takes two
				parameters. These include a string specifying the type of event to listen for, in this case
				<b>"keydown"</b> or <b>"keyup"</b>, and a function to call when the event is activated, which an event
				object is automatically passed to.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>keyCode</b> variable of the event object contains an integer that represents the ID of the key
				being pressed or released. A switch statement is used to check which key code corresponds to which key
				variable. They key variables are set to 1 when activated in the <b>keydown</b> event and 0 in the
				<b>keyup</b> event.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the key code of a desired key, you can find a table online containing all key codes, or if you
				prefer to not visit any other sites, write a function yourself that prints the key code of the last
				pressed key.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Keyboard Input </p>
				<br>
				var kl = 0, kr = 0, ku = 0, kd = 0, k1 = 0, k2 = 0;
				<br><br>
				<p class="comment"> // Listen for keyboard input </p>
				<br>
				document.addEventListener("keydown", function(e)
				<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>switch (e.keyCode)</p>
					<p>{</p>
					<div class="tab">
						<p>case 37:{kl=1;e.preventDefault();break;}</p>
						<p>case 39:{kr=1;e.preventDefault();break;}</p>
						<p>case 40:{kd=1;e.preventDefault();break;}</p>
						<p>case 38:{ku=1;e.preventDefault();break;}</p>
						<br>
						<p>case 90:{k1=1;break;}</p>
						<p>case 13:{k2=1;break;}</p>
					</div>
					<p>}</p>
				</div>
				});<br>
				document.addEventListener("keyup", function(e)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>switch (e.keyCode)</p>
					<p>{</p>
					<div class="tab">
						<p>case 37:{kl=0;break;}</p>
						<p>case 39:{kr=0;break;}</p>
						<p>case 40:{kd=0;break;}</p>
						<p>case 38:{ku=0;break;}</p>
						<br>
						<p>case 90:{k1=0;break;}</p>
					</div>
					<p>}</p>
				</div>
				});<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Key codes <b>37</b> through <b>40</b> represent the arrow keys. When they are activated in the
				<b>keydown</b> event, the function <b>preventDefault</b> of the event object is called to prevent the
				default action of these keys, which scroll around the page. Without calling this function, the player
				would unintentionally scroll around the webpage when trying to play, which makes games nearly
				unplayable.
			</p>
			<p>
				With these two <b>keydown</b> and <b>keyup</b> events we can now detect when keys are held down, but not
				when they are initially pressed. To implement key press detection, the function <b>stopKeyRepeat</b> is
				used, which simply sets the keys we only want to detect initial presses on to <b>0</b>.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function stopKeyRepeat()<br>
				{<br>
				<p class="tab">k2 = 0;</p>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				This function is called every game loop after objects are done updating. When the keys it affects are
				pressed and set to <b>1</b>, the game objects will run their update function once before the key is set
				back to <b>0</b>, only activated upon another initial press of the key. The game loop is a function that
				evaluates every game frame, and it will be explained in the next section.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="objects">Game Loop & Objects</h2>
			<p>
				In the game, the game loop is contained in the function <b>gmLoop</b>. This function executes a single
				frame of the game, and then calls the function <b>requestAnimationFrame</b> to call itself again in 1/60
				of a second, resulting in game frames being drawn at 60 frames per second.
			</p>
			<p>
				To render a frame, the <b>gmLoop</b> function clears the canvas, draws the background, executes the
				update function of all objects that may draw themselves, and finally executes more code that isn't tied
				to any object, including the spawning of asteroids and drawing of the current score.

				Object instances are kept in the <b>inst</b> array. To update them, the <b>inst</b> array is looped
				through, and the update function of each instance, <b>ud</b>, is executed. The update functions contain
				the code executed by each instance every frame. These usually include moving the instance, checking for
				collisions, and drawing the instance.
			</p>
			<p>
				New object instances are created using the function <b>makeInst</b> as a constructor. You can see this
				in action in the code example above, where asteroids are spawned with this line:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				new makeInst(x, y, 3);
			</div>
			<p>
				The third argument of <b>makeInst</b> is the ID of the object type being created. 0 is used for the
				creation of the player's ship, 1 is used for bullets, 2 is used for asteroids, and so forth. 3 is passed
				to this <b>makeInst</b> in this example because it creates the alert objects that flash for a few
				seconds before spawning an asteroid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's take a deeper look into the code of <b>makeInst</b>.
			</p>
			<div class="code">

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Object instances are added to the <b>inst</b> array as soon as the <b>makeInst</b> function is called.
				If there is no room left in the array for new instances, the instance being created will overwrite
				another instance as long as the instance's <b>ps</b> variable, which indicates persistence, is not set
				to <b>true</b>. The object-specific variables and update function are determined by the switch
				statement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes different objects execute the same sets of code, such as collision checking and screen
				wrapping. These are stored in functions so that they don't have to be written over and over again for
				each object. For an object instance to call these functions properly, a reference to one of them must be
				stored in an instance variable, and then called from that reference. This is demonstrated in the
				following code:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Get a reference to the function </p>
				<br>
				this.shoot = oSpaceshipShoot;<br>
				<br>
				<p class="comment"> // Call the function </p>
				<br>
				this.shoot();<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Calling the function without a reference causes the keyword <b>this</b> to not reference the object
				instance. It is valid to call functions without a reference that do not need to reference the instance
				calling the object, such as <b>gmEnd</b>, which simply ends the game without accessing any instance
				variables, though this is rarely done.
			</p>
			<p>
				To summarize, <b>gameLoop</b> is called 60 times a second to draw a new game frame and update object
				instances by calling their <b>ud</b> function.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="physics">Spaceship Physics</h2>
			<p>
				The spaceship object keeps track of the direction it points in with its <b>dir</b> variable, and keeps
				track of its momentum in two arrays, <b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b>, both of equal length. When the
				up key is held, the object adds the amount of pixels it should move horizontally and vertically in
				<b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b> respectively, this is calculated with sine and cosine waves with the
				direction of the ship as input.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Move ship </p>
				<br>
				if (ku)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>this.xforces[this.force] = Math.cos(this.dir) * this.forceSpeed;</p>
					<p>this.yforces[this.force] = Math.sin(this.dir) * this.forceSpeed;</p>
					<br>
					<p>++this.force;</p>
					<p>if (this.force &gt;= PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT)</p>
					<p class="tab">this.force = 0;</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The more the direction is turned to 0 or pi radians, the more the ship will move horizontally, and the
				more the direction is turned to pi/2 or 3pi/2 radians, the more the ship will move vertically. The
				forces added are multipled by <b>forceSpeed</b> to control the speed that the ship picks up each frame.
			</p>
			<p>
				Indexes of the <b>xforces</b> and <b>yforces</b> arrays are accessed with the variable <b>force</b>.
				Each time forces are added, <b>force</b> increments to move to the next index, and loops back to 0 when
				the end of the arrays, stored in <b>PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT</b>, are reached.
			</p>
			<p>
				The forces are finally applied to the ship and move it in the loop below, which is executed regardless
				of whether or not the up key is held down.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Apply movement </p>
				<br>
				for (var i = 0; i &lt; PLAYER_FORCE_COUNT; ++i)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>this.x += this.xforces[i];</p>
					<p>this.y += this.yforces[i];</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				In the end, this creates a system where forces applied in past frames still move the ship until the ship
				either moves for long enough that the forces are overwritten, or the ship moves in the opposite
				direction to balance the force. This is why the ship "drifts" ingame instead of staying still or
				immediately changing the direction of movement once any amount of force is added.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="wrapping">Screen Wrapping</h2>
			<p>
				To keep the player and asteroids within the bounds of the screen, the x and y values of the objects are
				reset once they reach the edge of the screen.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oWorldWrap()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>if (this.x &gt; GAME_WIDTH)</p>
					<p class="tab">this.x = GAME_WIDTH - this.x;</p>
					<p>else if (this.x &lt; 0)</p>
					<p class="tab">this.x = GAME_WIDTH + this.x;</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>if (this.y &gt; GAME_HEIGHT)</p>
					<p class="tab">this.y = GAME_HEIGHT - this.y; </p>
					<p>else if (this.y &lt; 0)</p>
					<p class="tab">this.y = GAME_HEIGHT + this.y;</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				When the x and y values are reset, they are positioned relative to how far the object has move past the
				bounds of the screen. For example, if the screen with is 600 pixels and the object's x position is at
				650, the x value will be reset to 0 plus 50 because it traveled 50 pixels beyond the screen. This
				results in no loss of movement when wrapping around the screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				The code above properly handles the coordinates of objects, but we still need to draw objects while they
				are wrapping from one side of the screen to the next to make wrapping entirely seamless. This is
				accomplished by drawing the objects in all 8 directions around them with the following code:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oDrawWrap()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>var xstop = this.x + GAME_WIDTH;</p>
					<p>var ystop = this.y + GAME_HEIGHT;</p>
					<br>
					<p>for (var x = this.x - GAME_WIDTH - 1; x &lt;= xstop; x += GAME_WIDTH)</p>
					<p>{</p>
					<div class="tab">
						<p>for (var y = this.y - GAME_HEIGHT - 1; y &lt;= ystop; y += GAME_HEIGHT)</p>
						<p>{</p>
						<p class="tab">this.draw(x, y);</p>
						<p>}</p>
					</div>
					<p>}</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Each object is spaced horizontally by the screen width, and spaced vertically by the screen height. This
				effect causes objects to appear on top of the screen when wrapping from the bottom, on the left of the
				screen when wrapping from the right, and so forth.
			</p>
			<p>
				This draws a total of 9 images, so it should be used sparingly, as drawing is a computationally
				expensive operation. It also has room for optimization, as it can be edited to only draw objects based
				on the direction they are moving in.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="shooting">Shooting</h2>
			<p>
				This section covers the mechanics of bullet firing by the spaceship object that the player controls.
				Bullets, like the spaceship itself, are objects created with <b>makeInst</b> that have speeds
				initialized upon their creation which go unchanged until the object is destroyed. The following function
				is used by spaceship instances to create them.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oSpaceshipShoot()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>var bullet = new makeInst(this.x, this.y, 1);</p>
					<p>bullet.hsp = Math.cos(this.dir) * this.bulletSpeed;</p>
					<p>bullet.vsp = Math.sin(this.dir) * this.bulletSpeed;</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Bullets use two variables to move each frame, <b>hsp</b> and <b>vsp</b> which control the bullets'
				horizontal speed and vertical speed respectively. These are used instead of a direction and speed
				variable to control bullet movement because they only need to be calculated once, while direction
				calculations must be performed every frame to move a bullet. This improves performance, especially when
				many bullets objects are in action at once.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rate at which bullets are fired are dependent on two variables in the spaceship object,
				<b>shootCooldown</b> and <b>shootCooldownReset</b>. <b>shootCooldown</b> is decremented each frame in
				the spaceship's <b>ud</b> function until it reaches <b>0</b>. When the Z key is pressed or held at this
				point, a bullet will be fired, and <b>shootCooldown</b> will be set to <b>shootCooldownReset</b>. The
				player must wait until <b>shootCooldown</b> reaches <b>0</b> to fire another bullet, or let go of the Z
				key to immediately set the cooldown to <b>0</b>. Below is the code that the spaceship runs to perform
				all of this:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Shooting </p>
				<br>
				if (this.shootCooldown == 0)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>if (k1)</p>

			<h2 id="asteroids">Asteroids</h2>
			<p>
				Asteroids are spawned by alert objects, which are spawned by an if statement found in <b>gmLoop</b>
				shown below. The spawning is influenced by three global variables: <b>spawning</b>, <b>spawnTime</b>,
				and <b>spawnTimeReset</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>spawning</b> is a boolean that controls whether or not asteroids can spawn.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>spawnTime</b> is an integer that decrements each frame until it reaches <b>0</b>, at which point an
				alert object will spawn.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>spawnTimeReset</b> is the value that <b>spawnTime</b> is reset to upon reaching <b>0</b>, and it
				decreases by <b>SPAWN_TIME_DEC</b> each time an alert object is created. This shortens the amount of
				time between alert spawns until <b>spawnTimeReset</b> reaches the minimum spawn time,
				<b>SPAWN_TIME_MIN</b>.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<p class="comment"> // Spawn Asteroids </p>

				{<br>

				Alert objects draw a blinking exclamation mark symbol onto the screen before spawning an asteroid. This
				is done to give the player time to react before each asteroid spawns. Their update function, shown
				below, is very simple:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oAlertUD()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p class="comment">// Duration</p>
					<br>
					<p>if ((--this.dur) == 0)</p>
					<p>{</p>
					<div class="tab">
						<p class="comment">// Spawn an asteroid, then delete self</p>
						<br>
						<p>new makeInst(this.x, this.y, 2);</p>
						<p>killInst(this);</p>
					</div>
					<p>}</p>
					<br>
					<p class="comment">// Animation</p>
					<br>
					<p>if ((--this.frames) == 0)</p>
					<p>{</p>
					<div class="tab">

						<p>this.frame1 = !this.frame1;</p>

					</div>
					<p>}</p>
					<br>
					<p class="comment">// Drawing</p>
					<br>
					<p>c.drawImage(this.frame1 ? sAlert1 : sAlert2, this.x, this.y);</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				Asteroids are also very simple. They wrap around the screen with the same functions as spaceships, and
				move similarly to bullets with <b>hsp</b> and <b>vsp</b> values, however, these variables are
				initialized in <b>makeInst</b> rather than being set by another instance, i.e., spaceship instances
				setting bullet speeds. Here is their update function:
			</p>
			<div class="code">

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The only complex piece of code is the collision checking for bullets, which will be explained in the
				next section.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="collision">Collision</h2>
			<p>
				Collision between object instances is done with the function <b>checkRect</b>, which checks for a
				collision between two rectangles. It takes 8 parameters: the x, y, width, and height of two different
				rectangles, and returns a boolean. The only precondition is that the variables for the smaller rectangle
				is passed first.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function checkRect(x1,y1,w1,h1,x2,y2,w2,h2)<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">

				</div>
				}<br>

				This function is used by another two functions: <b>oCollideWithSmaller</b> and
				<b>oCollideWithLarger</b>. These functions are called by object instances to check for collisions
				between all instances of another type of object. This is done by looping through <b>inst</b> to find all
				instances of the object type and calling <b>checkRect</b> with their variables. If a collision is found,
				the instance collided with is returned, otherwise <b>null</b> is returned. Here is
				<b>oCollideWithSmaller</b>:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oCollideWithSmaller(o, x1, y1, w1, h1, s1, s2, w2, h2)<br>
				<p>{</p>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>var other; </p>
					<p>for (var i = 0; i &lt; MAX_INSTANCES; ++i)</p>

					{
					<div class="tab">
						<p>other = inst[i];</p>
						<p>if (other != null &amp;&amp; other.o == o)</p>
						<p>{</p>
						<div class="tab">
							<p>if (checkRect(other.x + s1, other.y + s2, w2, h2, x1, y1, w1, h1))</p>
							<p>return other;</p>
						</div>
						<p>}</p>
					</div>
					<p>}</p>
					<p>return null;</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The function <b>oCollideWithLarger</b> is identical to <b>oCollideWithSmaller</b> except the order of
				rectangles passed to <b>checkRect</b> is reversed. This is because the functionality of <b>checkRect</b>
				depends on the smaller rectangle being passed first. The two "collide with" functions exist to check for
				collisions with objects that are smaller than the calling instance or larger.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason two "collide with" functions exist despite much of their code being the same is to improve
				performance. If there was only one "collide with" function that required an extra if statement to
				determine which set of objects was smaller, performance would suffer, because that if statement would be
				run for every single instance of the object type being searched for.

		<section>
			<h2 id="screens">Title/Game/End Screens</h2>
			<p>
				This section covers the code behind the multiple "screens" of the game, those being the title screen,
				gameplay screen, and game over screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				The title screen is run by calling the function <b>gmTitle</b>. This simply creates a title screen
				object and starts the game loop.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function gmTitle()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>new makeInst(0, 0, 4);</p>
					<p>gmLoop();</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The update function of the title object draws the title text and starts the game when enter is pressed
				by calling <b>gmStart</b>.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oTitleUD()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>c.textAlign = "center";</p>
					<p>c.font = "20px Courier";</p>
					<p>c.fillStyle = TEXT_COLOR_GREEN;</p>
					<p>c.fillText("the game finished loading. yay.", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 120);</p>
					<p>c.fillStyle = TEXT_COLOR_WHITE;</p>
					<p>c.fillText("Bad Asteroid Game", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 60);</p>
					<p>c.fillStyle = TEXT_COLOR_GREEN;</p>
					<p>c.fillText("by Luke Lawlor", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 30);</p>
					<p>c.fillText("Press Enter to Play", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF + 20);</p>
					<br>
					<p>if (k2)</p>
					<p class="tab">gmStart();</p>
				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The function <b>gmStart</b> destroys all object instances by filling <b>inst</b> with null values,
				starts the spawning of asteroids, sets the score to <b>0</b>, and creates a spaceship object.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function gmStart()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>inst.fill(null);</p=>
					<p>spawning = true;</p>
					<p>spawnTimeReset = SPAWN_TIME_START;</p>
					<p>spawnTime = 10;</p>
					<p>score = 0;</p>
					<p>new makeInst(100, 80, 0);</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The final screen changing function is <b>gmEnd</b>. This destroys all object instances, records the high
				score, stops the spawning of asteroids, and creates a game over screen object.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function gmEnd()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>if (score &gt; highScore)</p>
					<p class="tab">highScore = score;</p>
					<p>inst.fill(null);</p>
					<p>spawning = false;</p>
					<p>new makeInst(0, 0, 5);</p>

				</div>
				}<br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The game over screen object draws the game over text and restarts the game by calling <b>gmStart</b>,
				just as the title screen object does.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				function oEndUD()<br>
				{<br>
				<div class="tab">
					<p>c.textAlign = "center";</p>
					<p>c.font = "20px Courier";</p>
					<p>c.fillStyle = TEXT_COLOR_WHITE;</p>
					<p>c.fillText("G A M E O V E R", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 60);</p>
					<p>c.fillStyle = TEXT_COLOR_GREEN;</p>
					<p>c.fillText("Score: " + score, GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 30);</p>
					<p>c.fillText("High Score: " + highScore, GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF - 12);</p>
					<p>c.fillText("Press Enter to Replay", GAME_WIDTH_HALF, GAME_HEIGHT_HALF + 20);</p>
					<br>
					<p>if (k2)</p>
					<p class="tab">gmStart();</p>
